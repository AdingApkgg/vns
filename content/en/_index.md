## Basic Help

1. If you have the means, please support the official version on the work’s official website! Please don’t overly promote piracy!
2. Starting from **June 4, 2024**, this site will switch to long-interval, irregular updates of resource indexes. During this time, we will only ensure the basic operation of the site as the webmaster is busy dealing with life...
3. If you encounter download issues, try using `magic` and then retry. If it still doesn’t work, use `advanced magic`. If it *still* doesn’t work, switch to a different `download mirror` and try again...
4. If a feature isn’t working, try switching browsers, disabling ad blockers and antivirus tools, and accessing the site in private or guest mode! You can also try <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> to refresh the cache~
5. Make good use of the site’s search function <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd>. Results will appear after the search loads. For in-page searches, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> works better within articles.
6. Do not use the online decompression feature of cloud storage services, as it may cause files to be locked, which benefits no one!!
7. Localization patches may occasionally be quarantined by `Windows` built-in antivirus. You’ll need to manually allow them.
8. To play `Android` games on `Windows`, you can use emulators that simulate a computer environment, such as [Mobox](https://github.com/olegos2/mobox/blob/main/README-zh_CN.md), [Winlator](https://winlator.org/), or [JoiPlay](https://joiplay.org/).
9. To play `PSP` games on `Windows`, `macOS`, `Linux`, `Android`, or `iOS`, you can use the `PSP` emulator [PPSSPP](https://www.ppsspp.org/).
10. Avoid using domestic browsers. We recommend [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/zh-CN/chrome/) or [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/zh-CN/firefox/) to prevent interception.
11. If you encounter issues, search for solutions using relevant keywords on [Baidu](https://www.baidu.com/), [Bing](https://www.bing.com/), or [Google](https://www.google.com/).
12. For `Windows`, use professional decompression tools like [7-Zip](https://sparanoid.com/lab/7z/), [Bandizip](https://www.bandisoft.com/bandizip/), or [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/) to extract resources. Otherwise, extraction may fail.
13. For `Android`, we recommend these decompression apps: [MT Manager](https://mt2.cn/), [ZA](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.zdevs.zarchiver&pcampaignid=web_share), or [ES File Explorer](http://www.estrongs.com/).
14. For `BT torrent` or magnet links, use [qBittorrent](https://github.com/c0re100/qBittorrent-Enhanced-Edition) on `Windows` or [ADM](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dv.adm&pcampaignid=web_share) on `Android`.
