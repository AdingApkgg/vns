The following staff members voluntarily dedicate their time and skills to keep VNS running as smoothly as possible! Thank you for their ongoing efforts and dedication.

We are looking for a few passionate individuals who are willing to **contribute out of love for free**. Work hours are flexible and not fixed, so you can start whenever you like~

If you are skilled in using advanced magic, can search for resources and write `Markdown` or `Word` documents following the general format of existing articles on this site... download and test resources to check if they are raw or localized, note the localization group name, version, and whether any `BUGs` appear... and are willing to support VNS, please feel free to contact us by clicking the nicknames of the staff members below.
