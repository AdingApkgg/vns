## Basic Help

1. If possible, please support the official version on the work's official website! Do not excessively promote piracy!
2. Starting from **June 4, 2024**, this site will enter a long-interval, irregular update schedule for resource indexing. During this period, only basic site operations will be guaranteed as the admin is dealing with life...
3. If you encounter download issues, try using `magic` and attempt again. If it still doesn’t work, use `advanced magic`. If it still doesn’t work, try switching to a different `download mirror`.
4. If a function is not working properly, try switching browsers, disabling ad blockers and antivirus tools, and accessing the site in private or guest mode! You can also try <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> to refresh the cache.
5. Make good use of the site’s search function <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd>. Results will appear after the search is fully loaded. For in-page searches, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> works better within articles.
6. Do not use the online decompression function of cloud storage services, as it may cause files to be blocked, which is not beneficial for you!
7. Localization patches may be quarantined by `Windows` built-in antivirus. You need to manually allow them.
8. To play `Android` games on `Windows`, use emulators that simulate a computer environment, such as [Mobox](https://github.com/olegos2/mobox/blob/main/README-zh_CN.md), [Winlator](https://winlator.org/), or [JoiPlay](https://joiplay.org/).
9. To play `PSP` games on `Windows`, `macOS`, `Linux`, `Android`, or `iOS`, use the PSP emulator [PPSSPP](https://www.ppsspp.org/).
10. Avoid using domestic browsers. Recommended browsers are [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/) or [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) to prevent being blocked.
11. If you encounter issues, search for solutions using relevant keywords on [Baidu](https://www.baidu.com/), [Bing](https://www.bing.com/), or [Google](https://www.google.com/).
12. For `Windows`, use professional decompression tools like [7-Zip](https://sparanoid.com/lab/7z/), [Bandizip](https://www.bandisoft.com/bandizip/), or [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/) to extract resources, or you’re very likely to encounter extraction failures.
13. For `Android`, recommended decompression apps include [MT Manager](https://mt2.cn/), [ZA](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.zdevs.zarchiver&pcampaignid=web_share), or [ES File Explorer](http://www.estrongs.com/).
14. For `BT magnet` links, use [qBittorrent](https://github.com/c0re100/qBittorrent-Enhanced-Edition) on `Windows` or [ADM](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dv.adm&pcampaignid=web_share) on `Android` for downloading.
